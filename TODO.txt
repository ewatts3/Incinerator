Infinite loop issue?

Composing:
Refine decision making for:
	When to end each voice
	When a voice should change (add more factors)
	How long a state should last (again more factors)
Needs to be shorter
Check unison - sounds good / happens twice sometimes
Dynamics - For ending - align all for unison dynamics?

From TR himself:
Have voices drop out
Transposing? Augementing rhythmic values?

QOL:
Make piano comp instrument
Make drum comp instrument
Buy full Ableton lmao
