Completely refactor with better planning?

Composing:
Refine decision making for:
	When to end each voice
	When a voice should change (add more factors)
	How many times a state should be repeated (again more factors)

QOL:
Make piano comp instrument
Make drum comp instrument
Buy full Ableton

Notes:
No transposing - no "stepping on each others toes - would change if have more variety of timbres
Augmenting values - ITS FACKIN HARD
Dynamics - do manually (increment of velocity too small?)
