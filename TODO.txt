Infinite loop issue?

Composing:
Refine decision making for:
	When to end each voice
	When a voice should change (add more factors)
	How long a state should last (again more factors)
Needs to be shorter
Check unison - sounds good / happens twice sometimes

From TR himself:
Have voices drop out
Dynamics
	Throughout
	During ending
Transposing? Augementing rhythmic values?

QOL:
Make piano comp instrument
Make drum comp instrument
Buy full Ableton lmao
